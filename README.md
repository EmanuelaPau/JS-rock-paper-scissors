<h2><strong>THE GAME:</strong></h2>
The rules of the game are the same of the old game rock, paper, scissors: 
<ul>
<li>Rock beats scissors</li>
<li>Paper beats Rock</li>
<li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
</ul>
To play the game you must push one of the three button. The first button is rock, the second button is paper and the third button is scissors. <br>
The computer will give a random answer to your choice and will appear a message that will tell if you won, lost or draw.<br><br>
